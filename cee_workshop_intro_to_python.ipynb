        "### What is Python?\n",
        "Python is a very simple, high-level dynamic and straightforward object-oriented programming language. It’s designed to be easy to program without prepared code and easy to read. Python was created in the late 1980s. It wasn’t named after the Python snake but after Monty Python. However, Python is not a comedy group but simply a programming language created by a Dutch computer programmer Guido van Rossum who is a fan of Monty Python! Python is a great building block for learning both procedural and object-oriented programming concepts, and is an ideal language for data analysis. \n",

        "### Why Python\n",
        "- Python is open source software.\n",
        "- Python is Object oriented and modular\n",
        "- Python is considered as a \"glue language\" because of its ability to connect libraries and programs that are implemented in other languages.\n",
        "- Python is a general-purpose language as it strong Framework support used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains from video games to big data analytics.\n",
        "- Python is dynamic where a variable is simply a value bound to a name only versus type.\n",
        "- Python is an interpreted language, which means bits of code can be executed in a running program rather than compiling the complete program\n",
        "- Python is easy to a human readable as it’s closer to English language. Python also uses indentation to give structure to the code, which makes it easy for both humans and computers to read.\n",
        "- Python supports introspection, which is very helpful during debugging complex algorithms."
